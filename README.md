# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially computer systems. It involves programming computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:
- Learning: Machines improve their performance over time by analyzing data (machine learning).
- Reasoning: AI can solve problems and make decisions based on logic and rules.
- Perception: AI systems can interpret sensory data (like recognizing images, speech, or patterns).
- Language Understanding: AI can understand, interpret, and respond to human language (natural language processing).

There are different types of AI:
- Narrow AI (Weak AI): AI designed to perform a specific task (like voice assistants, recommendation systems).
- General AI (Strong AI): AI with human-like intelligence, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across different tasks — still theoretical.
- Super AI: A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence — more sci-fi for now.

Common AI technologies include:
- Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming.
- Neural Networks: AI models inspired by the human brain, useful for tasks like image and speech recognition.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Helps machines understand and generate human language.
- Computer Vision: AI that processes and understands visual data from images or videos.

In simple terms, AI is about teaching computers to think and act like humans — or at least, to tackle complex tasks intelligently!
