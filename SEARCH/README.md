Search algorithms in AI are strategies used to explore and navigate through a problem space to find solutions. They help AI systems make decisions by searching through possible states or actions to achieve a goal.

## Applications of Search Algorithms:
### Pathfinding and Navigation:
Used in maps (Google Maps), robot motion planning, and game AI (NPC movement).

### Game AI:
Chess engines (like Stockfish), tic-tac-toe bots, and strategic planning in AI games.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Parsing sentences using search algorithms for syntax trees.

### Computer Vision:
Object detection can use search strategies to locate and classify items in an image.

### Scheduling and Planning:
AI systems for airline scheduling, job shop scheduling, etc.

### Diagnosis and Expert Systems:
Medical diagnosis AI may use search algorithms to explore symptom-disease mappings.
