# push this AI 8-puzzle game solver to github. Then add to resume. Build a frontend(possibly a website or add it to your portfolio). Take user input for initial state or generate random start state(ensure it's not goal by setting heuristic>6), then ask users to try and solve, at the end solve the problem with step by step moves
